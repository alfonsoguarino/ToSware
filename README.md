ToSware: making Terms of Service readable

Terms of Service (ToS) are fundamental factors in the creation of physical as well as online legally relevant relationships. They not only define mutual rights and obligations but also inform users about contract key issues that, in online settings, span from liability limitations to data management and processing conditions.
Despite their crucial role, however, ToS are often neglected by users that frequently accept without even reading what they agree upon, representing a critical issue when there exist potentially unfair clauses. 

To enhance users' awareness and uphold legal safeguards, we propose ToSware, an awareness (prototype) tool to measure the unfairness of online Terms of Service. ToSware has the ultimate goal of making terms of service more readable and understandable.

ToSware server component runs on Linux machines with more than 8GB RAM.

ToSware client component is a Google Chrome plugin/extension.
