           The <b style="color: green">jurisdiction clause</b> stipulates what courts will have the competence to
            adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers
            a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair,
            whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away
            (i.e. in a different city, different country) were marked as clearly unfair. This
            assessment is grounded in ECJ’s case law.

        <p style="border: solid orange; background-color: #f2f2f2" >

            The <b style="color: orange"> choice of law </b> clause specifies what law will govern the contract,
            meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute
            parising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of
            the consumer’s country of residence were marked as clearly fair.

        <p style="border: solid dimgray; background-color: #f2f2f2" >

           The <b style="color: dimgray"> limitation of liability </b> clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages
            is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions.
            Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers’ liabilities were marked
            as clearly fair.

        <p style="border: solid blue; background-color: #f2f2f2">

            The <b style="color: blue">unilateral change </b> clause specifies the conditions under which the
            service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself.
            Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair. This is
            because the ECJ has not yet issued a judgment in this regard, though the Annex to the Directive contains several examples supporting such a qualification.

        <p style="border: solid darkcyan; background-color: #f2f2f2">

           The <b style="color: darkcyan">unilateral termination</b>  clause gives provider the right to suspend
            and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the
            circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so. Unilateral termination clauses that specify reasons for termination were marked
            as potentially unfair. whereas clauses stipulating that the service provider may
            suspend or terminate the service at any time for any or no reasons and/or without notice were marked as clearly unfair.

        <p style="border: solid saddlebrown; background-color: #f2f2f2">

           The <b style="color: saddlebrown"> contract by using </b> clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by
            the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even
            being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always
            marked such clauses as potentially unfair. The reason for this choice is that
            a good argument can be offered for these clauses to be unfair, because they
            originate an imbalance in rights and duties of the parties, but this argument
            has no decisive authoritative backing yet, since the ECJ has never assessed
            a clause of this type.

          The <b style="color: sandybrown"> content removal </b> gives the provider a right to modify/delete user’s
            content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions
            under which the service provider may do so. As in the case of unilateral termination, clauses that indicate conditions for content removal were marked as
            potentially unfair, whereas clauses stipulating that the service provider may
            remove content in his full discretion, and/or at any time for any or no reasons and/or without notice nor possibility to retrieve the content were marked
            as clearly unfair.

          The <b style="color: red"> arbitration </b> clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. It is
            therefore considered a kind of forum selection clause. However, such a clause
            may or may not specify that arbitration should occur within a specific jurisdiction.

          The <b style="color: gold"> Potentiallu Unfair </b> indicate that often appearing in the terms of on-line services: 1)
establishing jurisdiction for disputes in a country different than consumers
residence; 2) choice of a foreign law governing the contract; 3) limitation of liability; 4) the provider’s right to unilaterally terminate the contract/access to
the service; and 5) the provider’s right to unilaterally modify the contract/the
service. Our research has identified three additional categories: 6) requiring
a consumer to undertake arbitration before the court proceedings can commence; 7) the provider retaining the right to unilaterally remove consumer
content from the service, including in-app purchases; 8) having a consumer
accept the agreement simply by using the service, not only without reading it,
but even without having to click on “I agree/I accept.”

          The <b style="color: red"> Unfair </b> indicate that contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated;
            and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights
            and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.
